# COMP9417 Group Assignment
# AUTHOR: Andrew Lau
# PURPOSE: Feature engineering for wifi, wifi location and GPS input datasets

# SUMMARY OF FEATURES ----------------------------------------------------------
# speed based features:
# speed of movement in a week may be indicate of levels of exercise/psych.
# health
# speed_mean - mean of speed observations in each week
# speed_sd - standard deviation of speed observations in each week
# speed_max - max of speed observations in each week

# travelstate based features:
# speed of movement in a week may be indicate of levels of exercise/psych.
# health
# travelstate_time_stationary - seconds spend stationary in each week
# travelstate_time_moving - seconds spend moving in each week

# indoor/outdoor based features:
# the paper uses network == 'gps' as a proxy for being outdoors. amount of time
# spent indoors/outdoors could be linked to psych. health
# outdoor_time - seconds spent outdoors (using GPS as a proxy, as per the paper)
  # in each week
# indoor_time - seconds spent indoors (using WiFi as a proxy, as per the paper)
  # in each week
# distance_moved_indoors - distance moved indoors (using WiFi as a proxy, as per
  # the paper) in each week
# distance_moved_outdoors - distance moved outdoors (using WiFi as a proxy, as
  # per the paper) in each week

# altitude based features:
# altitude_mean - mean altitude in each week
# altitude_sd - standard deviation of altitude in each week
# altitude_min - minimum of altitude in each week
# altitude_max - maximum of altitude in each week

# locations based features
# location_count - number of diffrent locations visited in each week
# if we have time, we can consider grouping the locations (e.g. gym, library)
# ^ this will be very time consuming though

# bearing - grouped into N E S W for outdoor data only
